1. Clone or download the repositiory to your local computer.
2. Import the dataset to clean and transfrom the data using Power Query editor. Refer to the project brief for description of table structure and column definitions.
3. Load the transformed data into PowerBI and create the data model.
4. Execute the DAX measure to analyse the data and create visuals to review the results.
5. Build the BI report to summarize insights and provide recommendations.
